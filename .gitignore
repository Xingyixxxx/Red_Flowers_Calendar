# Project Specific
data.json
# We might want to keep data.json if you want to commit your history, 
# but usually personal data is ignored. Uncomment the line above to ignore it. 
# For now, I'll assume you might WANT to commit your initial garden, 
# so I'll leave it commented out? actually, let's ignore it to be safe 
# so you don't accidentally publish private records if you open source it later.
# If you want to track your relationship data in git, remove 'data.json' from here.
